<h3>Getting started with Sense </h3>

<h3>Sense - iOS SDK</h3>

Sense is a device intelligence and identification tool. This tool collects a comprehensive set of attributes unique to a device or browser, forming an identity that will help businesses.
Requirements


<h3>Requirements</h3>

* OS 12.0 or above
* Swift version 5.0 and above

Note: If the application does not have the listed permissions, the values collected using those permissions will be ignored. To provide a valid device details, we recommend employing as much permission as possible based on your use-case.

Step 1 - Import SDK

```
 import SenseOS
````
Step 2 - Add Delegate Method

Add the delegate method in your Controller Class file
````
SenseOSDelegate
````

Step 3 - Get Device Details

Use the line below to invoke any button action or ViewDidLoad to get the DeviceDetails.

```
SenseOS.getSenseDetails(withDelegate: self)
let config = SenseOSConfig()
Sense.initSDK(senseConfig: config, withDelegate: self)
```

Step 4 - Location Permission (Optional)

You have to add this permission in Info.plist to get Device Location Information.

```
 <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
 <string>This app needs access to your location to provide location-based services.</string>
 <key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
 <string>Location access is required for enhanced app functionality.</string>
 <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
 <string>Require to get user location</string>

```

Step 5 - Implement Delegate Method

Set and Implement our Delegate method to receive the Callback details

```
 extension ViewController: SenseOSDelegate{
    func onFailure(message: String) {
        // Failure Callback.
    }
    func onSuccess(data: [String : Any]) {
        // Success Callback
    }
}

```

Sample Program

Here you can find the demonstration to do the integration.

```
import UIKit
import SenseOS

class SenseOSController: UIViewController, SenseOSDelegate {

  override func viewDidLoad() {
      super.viewDidLoad()
	SenseOS.getSenseDetails(withDelegate: self)
	Sense.initSDK(senseConfig: SenseOSConfig, withDelegate: self)
      
  }

  @objc func onSuccess(data: String) {     
      // Handle success callback
  }
  @objc func onFailure(message: String) {
      // Handle failure callback
  }
}

```
